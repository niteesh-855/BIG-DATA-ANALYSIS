* DESCRIPTION*:

I conducted scalable big data analysis on Flipkart's massive dataset utilizing PySpark to effectively handle and process high volumes of e-commerce data. Data cleaning, transformation, and exploration were conducted through Spark DataFrames for product categories, price, and customer ratings. Customer preferences, price trends, and top-selling product segments were among the key insights obtained through filtering, grouping, and aggregation operations. By taking advantage of PySpark's distributed computation, the data was processed much faster than using conventional tools such as pandas. This project clearly illustrated the performance and scalability of PySpark when dealing with actual big data use cases in the e-commerce sector.
